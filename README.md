# EE exploration

I spent most of my time in the research section of my junior self directed study diving deep into electrical engineering subjects. This is mainly because your junior project is more research based and I wanted to explore what electrical engineering concepts would improve my ability to understand circuits on an even deeper scientific and technical level. I began exploring openstacks briefly until switching to a khan academy course I had found on electrical Engineering. A lot of the initial concepts were familiar to me but since a lot of my engineering knowledge is self taught the course helped to fill in any gaps in my understanding.

After exploring the electrical engineering that khan academy had offered I had gone off to explore other engineering resources online that were more complex. From here I started to collect even more notes into my obsidian vault with in detail schematics, equations, and descriptions. After becoming more familiar with analog electronics instead of my usual digital hardware I was immediately able to understand how I would apply these concepts to improve previous design. On top of this was also able to better understand how to identify certain parts of a more complicated circuit by circuit analysis techniques. Also how to calculate for these circuits in different ways for different values.

At the later parts of my research I realized that for some of these concepts it just makes more sense to learn them in practice, compared to others. I wanted to experiment with the different logic gates to get a better understanding on how I might incorporate them into future circuit designs which relied heavily on TTL(transistor to transistor logic). With only a few days remaining in my project I swiftly created this logic demo board using the parts I had on hand.
